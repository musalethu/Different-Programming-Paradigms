# INTRODUCTION
This is an assignment about different programming paradigms and their advantages as well as their disadvantages.

We have two main programming paradigms which have been further subdivided into three sub-topics each which will be what I will mainly focus on.
We have the 1)Imperative programming paradigm and under it we have :
a) Procedural programming paradigm
b) Object Oriented programming 
c)Parallel processing Approach 
We also have 2)Declerative programming paradigm:
d)Logic programming paradigm
e)Fuctional programming paradigm
f)Database programming paradigm


# INTRODUCTION
 WHAT ARE PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS?
 These are different ways of writing code . <br>

 1)Imperative programming paradigm
 It is based on the sequence of perculiar commands to work out a complication and carry of a goal.  <br>
 b) Object Oriented programming 
 Utilises unrelated objects,each with an attribute and entity to come up with a solution for a problem.  <br> It is loaded with classes which makes the software  structure to be more easier, simple and reusable. <br>

-Advantages
1) It simple to implement.
2) It can contain variables, loops .

-Disadvantages
1) High complexity
2) Less efficient
3)It has no support for parallel programming


 2)Declerative programming paradigm
 It oulines the goal to attain with no directive to do so . <br>
 e)Fuctional programming paradigm
 It depends on the mathematical functions to make immutable programs. <br> This is a style of programming where the solution is simple and there are no side effects. <br>

 -Advantages
1)The focus is more on what should be done.

-Disadvantages
1)There is no focus on how to do what should be done.
2)The properties are desribed while not explaining how to compute it.
