# Different-Programming-Paradigms
In this repo I've created a folder for code examples.



 I've created two separate files for my two main programming paradigms . One I named it declarative.js for the declerative programming paradigm and the other imperative.js for the Imperative programming paradigm. In these two files this is where i've written my code examples.
