# Different-Programming-Paradigms
In this repo I've outlined and explained about different programming paradigms. 
Firstly I created a post file so that I write answers for the assignment as a blog post. It was advisable that I add a ReadMe file.

On my introduction I've written about the two major paradigms and included their different categories or sub topics.

I've further given full information about programming paradigms on my body where I go deep into each and every programming language. I even further elaborated about thier pros and cons .

I then created a folder for my code examples where I created two separate files for my two main programming paradigms . One I named it declarative.js for the declerative programming paradigm and the other imperative.js for the Imperative programming paradigm. In these two files this is where i've written my code examples.
